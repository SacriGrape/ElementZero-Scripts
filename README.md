# What is ElementZero?
ElementZero is a mod loader for the BDS server software. It can be found here: https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero

# Using scripts
These scripts use the EZ scripting API as well as the vanilla one. They all will require using a different type of index.js foor managing the scripts.
I have left both a template index.js script and an example one that I myself have made and use.
Inside of the template script are comments that explain where to put what and what format you should have them in. My example script shows them in action. The example script is for 3 of the scripts here. `PlayerLink.js`, `IPBans.js`, and `permissionHandler.js`.
